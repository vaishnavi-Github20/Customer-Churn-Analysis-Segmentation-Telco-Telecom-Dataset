# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis & Segmentation | Telco Telecom Dataset

This repository presents an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project focused on **customer churn prediction and segmentation** using real-world telecom data. The objective is to uncover behavioral patterns of customers who are likely to leave the service and provide actionable business insights for reducing churn and improving retention.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of churn across demographics
- Churn by contract type, tenure, and services (Internet, Streaming, etc.)
- Correlation analysis of numeric features

✅ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values in TotalCharges
- Encoding categorical variables
- Removing duplicates, correcting data types

✅ Segmentation via Clustering
- Applied clustering algorithms to group customers based on usage & churn likelihood

✅ Predictive Modeling
- Built and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Evaluated using:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 💼 Business Insights
- Customers with fiber optic internet and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

- Senior citizens show a slightly higher churn rate.

- Users with high monthly charges and short tenure are at high risk.

## Business Recommendations:

- Loyalty discounts for new customers

- Bundle services to increase stickiness

- Promote long-term contracts

- Specialized support for elderly users

- Proactive retention for high-risk customers

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

- Jupyter Notebook

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Tableau / Power BI (optional for dashboard visualizations)

---

## 📊 Use Case
